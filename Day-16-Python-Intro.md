# 🐍 Day 16: Introduction to Python (The Hacker's Language)

**Date:** 22 Jan 2026

**Phase 3 Start:** Today, I started learning Python. In the cybersecurity world, Python is King because it is simple to write and powerful enough to create viruses, scanners, and exploit tools.

### 🧠 Why Python?
1.  **Simple Syntax:** It reads like English. (No complex `{}` like Java/C++).
2.  **Powerful Libraries:** It has pre-built codes for networking (`socket`), web (`requests`), and hacking (`scapy`).
3.  **Automation:** If a task takes 1 hour manually, a Python script can do it in 1 second.

### 🛠️ Hands-on Lab: My First Code
I verified that Python is installed and wrote my first program.

**Step 1: Check Python Version**
Most Linux systems come with Python pre-installed.
```bash
python3 --version
# Output: Python 3.10.x (or similar)
```
Step 2: The Interactive Shell I opened the python shell to run commands instantly.
```bash
python3
```
Step 3: Hello World
```bash
print("Hello Hacker!")
# Output: Hello Hacker!
```
Step 4: Variables (Containers) Variables are like boxes where we store data.
```bash
ip_address = "192.168.1.1"
port = 80
status = "Open"

print("Scanning IP:", ip_address)
print("Port:", port, "is", status)
```
Step 5: Exit To close Python, I typed:
```bash
exit()
