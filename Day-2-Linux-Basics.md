# 🐧 Day 2: Linux Basics & Navigation

**Date:** 08 Jan 2026

Today, I started learning the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI). Unlike Windows, where we mostly use a mouse, Linux relies heavily on terminal commands for efficiency and control.

### 📂 Essential Commands I Learned:

| Command | Full Form | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pwd` | Print Working Directory | Tells me "Where am I?" in the file system. |
| `ls` | List | Shows all files and folders in the current location. |
| `mkdir <name>` | Make Directory | Creates a new folder (directory). |
| `cd <name>` | Change Directory | Moves me into a specific folder. |
| `cd ..` | Change Directory Back | Takes me one step back/up in the folder structure. |
| `clear` | Clear Screen | Cleans up the terminal window. |

### 🧠 Why is this important?
Most hacking tools and servers run on Linux. Mastering the terminal is the first step to becoming a security professional.

### 🛠️ How to Practice Online (No Installation Needed)
If you don't have a high-end PC or Linux installed yet, don't worry! You can practice these commands directly in your web browser.
