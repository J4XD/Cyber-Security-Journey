My daily progress from Noob to Pro.

# My Cyber Security Journey 🚀

**Start Date:** 07 Jan 2026
**Status:** Beginner (Noob)

### 🎯 My Goals:
1. Learn Linux Basics
2. Understand Networking (IP, DNS, OSI)
3. Learn Python for Security
4. Solve CTF Challenges

### 📅 Day 1 Update:
Today, I set up my GitHub repository.
I learned that the **CIA Triad** is the foundation of information security:
- **C**onfidentiality (Keeping data secret)
- **I**ntegrity (Preventing unauthorized data alteration)
- **A**vailability (Ensuring data is always accessible)

# 🐧 Linux Basics - Day 2

**Date:** 08 Jan 2026

Today, I started learning the Linux Command Line Interface (CLI). Unlike Windows, where we mostly use a mouse, Linux relies heavily on terminal commands for efficiency and control.

### 📂 Essential Commands I Learned:

| Command | Full Form | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `pwd` | Print Working Directory | Tells me "Where am I?" in the file system. |
| `ls` | List | Shows all files and folders in the current location. |
| `mkdir <name>`| Make Directory | Creates a new folder (directory). |
| `cd <name>` | Change Directory | Moves me into a specific folder. |
| `cd ..` | Change Directory Back | Takes me one step back/up in the folder structure. |
| `clear` | Clear Screen | Cleans up the terminal window. |

### 🧠 Why is this important?
Most hacking tools and servers run on Linux. Mastering the terminal is the first step to becoming a security professional.
